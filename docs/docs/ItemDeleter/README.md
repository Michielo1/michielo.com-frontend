## Introduction

Here you can find the documentation for ItemDeleter. ItemDeleter is a spigot-based plugin that is capable of deleting items and/or blocks from the server. This is done by removing these specified items/blocks from chests, inventories, mob-drops and more.

**WARNING:** Removing blocks from the game is *NOT* enabled by default for performance reasons. Please read [Configuration](/ItemDeleter/configuration.md) and [Performance Guide](/ItemDeleter/performance.md) to learn how to enable this in your preferred way.
