# Commands

Here you can find all commands. 

In general you will not need any debug commands, these commands exist out of the recognized necessity for stability as this plugin could be used in RP settings. That is not to say any issues will completely disappear which is why I do encourage you to share issues/bugs, even if a debug command resolves the issue. 

## Basic commands

| Command  | Argument | Permission | Description |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| ``magicwands``  | ``wands``     | ``MagicWands.wands`` | Returns all currently available wands |
| ``magicwands``  | ``get <wand>``  | ``MagicWands.get`` | Gives the player executing the command the specified wand |
| ``magicwands`` | ``reload`` | ``MagicWands.reload`` | Reloads the configuration file |

## Debug commands

| Command  | Argument | Permission | Description |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------|
| ``magicwands``  | ``clearSession``     | ``MagicWands.clear`` | Clears active wand sessions. Using this could fix any weird behavior, although I do still encourage you to report any issues! |
